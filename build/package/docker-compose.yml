# Sample docker-compose configuration file for InfluxDB, Grafana,
# pwimport, and scimport.
#
# /opt/appdata on the container host holds directories that are the
# persistent storage for each container, such as database stores,
# configuration files, etc.  These directories should be created
# before starting up the containers:
#   /opt/appdata/influxdb
#   /opt/appdata/grafana
#   /opt/appdata/scimport
# (pwimport has no persistent storage)
#
version: '2'
services:
  # InfluxDB container.  This holds the timeseries database that is the
  # backing store for the Powerwall and Supercharger measurements.

  # pwimport container, built from sources.  Take note of the PWI_POLL
  # setting...this is how often (in seconds) it polls the Powerwall
  # gateway on the local network.  This number has worked fine on my setup
  # but if for some reason you think it's polling too often, make the
  # number larger.  Note the pwimport default is 10 seconds.
